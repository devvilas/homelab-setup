# My homelab cloud setup!

## What is this?
A couple of months ago (or maybe one year?), I got a old Dell Poweredge R620. It was great! I loved linux and stuff so having my own server was a dream! My first homelab. Besides... how hard will it be?

WRONG! It was hard! Not hard in the part of configuring but taking care of the server and keep the same config. I switched between Ubuntu and Proxmox more times than I can count.

Recently, I got a new node for this, a HP pro something (those pre built workstations).

So, I decided, for once, try built a config for my homelab to last, and, document the process! Why? Well it's fun, and, it's useful later to show my skills :\)

## The structure of this project

Okay so for this, I organised this in folders, here's the structure:
